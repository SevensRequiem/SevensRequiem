# ::Requiem

99' self-taught dev oscillating between high-level Go and low-level C++/asm. tunnel-vision coding, sleep optional (Go version):

```go
func main() {
	go func() { /* do something */ }()
}
```

stats:

* commits made: enough to regret
* repos active: depends on my dopamine levels
* issues opened: usually my own fault
* languages ranked: go > c++ > asm > everything else > php > nodejs > rust
  
#1 spot may go to [Carbon](carbon-language/carbon-lang)!

jk rust is pretty cool

// hikikomori since 2013

// low-level wizard soon-ish?

// NOT a war-criminal in China, Russia, or Bhutan!

if I vanish, I'm building something or forgot reality existed.

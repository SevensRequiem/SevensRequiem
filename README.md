### 🧠 About Me
I'm a self-taught web developer & occasional sysadmin, building things at the edge of structure and chaos. I enjoy creating scalable systems, beautiful UIs, and tools that actually solve problems.  
Currently working on full-stack projects, with an eye on performance, security, and autonomy.

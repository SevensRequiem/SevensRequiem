99' self-taught dev oscillating between high-level Go and low-level C++/asm. tunnel-vision coding, sleep optional

```go
func main() {
	go func() { /* do something */ }()
}
```

stats:
* commits made: enough to regret
* repos active: depends on my dopamine levels
* issues opened: usually my own fault
* languages ranked: go > c++ > asm > everything else > php > nodejs > rust (jk rust is pretty cool)

#1 spot may go to [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang) in the future!
